@article{Shaw2002,
	abstract = {Physics, biology, and medicine have well-refined public explanations of their research processes. Even in simplified form, these provide guidance about what counts as "good research" both inside and outside the field. Soft- ware engineering has not yet explicitly identified and explained either our re- search processes or the ways we recognize excellent work. Science and engineering research fields can be characterized in terms of the kinds of questions they find worth investigating, the research methods they adopt, and the criteria by which they evaluate their results. I will present such a characterization for software engineering, showing the diversity of research strategies and the way they shift as ideas mature. Understanding these strategies should help software engineers design research plans and report the results clearly; it should also help explain the character of software engineering re- search to computer science at large and to other scientists. 1},

@misc{Sackett2000,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Self sampling is considered an adjuvant tool to facilitate the participation of women in cervical cancer screening programmes. This study aimed to evaluate whether cervicovaginal lavage could be an alternative for the cervical smear in cytology and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing and to assess the acceptance of the self sampling device by women. METHODS: Fifty six women with abnormal cervical cytology (very mild dyskaryosis or worse) and 15 women with normal cervical cytology obtained a self collected cervicovaginal lavage at home and filled in a questionnaire on the use of the device. At the colposcopy clinic the gynaecologist performed the same procedure followed by a cervical smear for cytology and HPV DNA testing. RESULTS: The self sampling device was acceptable to 88{\%} of the women. The concordance between the cytology results in the smear and the lavage by the doctor and the patient was 54{\%} and 41{\%}, respectively (kappa = 0.28 and 0.14). The concordance between high risk HPV detection in the smear and the lavage by the doctor and the patient was 93{\%} and 78{\%}, respectively (kappa = 0.82 and 0.53). Ninety one per cent of the women with high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) had a high risk HPV positive test in the smear, compared with 91{\%} and 81{\%} in the lavages taken by the doctor and the patient, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: HPV DNA testing by home obtained samples is useful as a screening tool for cervical cancer, whereas cervical cytology by self sampling is not. Although the sensitivity for high grade CIN by high risk HPV testing in the lavage by the patient is not significantly lower than that in the cervical smear, self sampling for HPV DNA is a feasible alternative method in women who decline to participate in population based cervical cancer screening programmes. However, participation in the screening programme remains the best option.},

@book{Wohlin2012,
	abstract = {Empirical software engineering research can be organized in several ways, including experiments, cases studies, and surveys. Experiments sample over the variables, trying to represent all possible cases; cases studies sample from the variables, representing only the typical cases(s). Every case study or experiment should have a hypothesis to express the desired result. The experimental design is especially important because it identifies key variables and their relationships. The design uses balancing, blocking, and local control to help minimize error. Analysis techniques depend on the design, the distribution of the data, and the type of investigation being carried out. Different techniques allow us to look at variable interaction and to look at combinations of effects. Using a technique similar to a board game, we can determine when we have enough evidence to demonstrate clear relationships among variables. ?? 1997 Academic Press Inc.},

@article{Wohlin2013EvidenceProfile,
abstract = {Evidence-based software engineering has emerged as an important part of software engineering. The need for empirical evaluation and hence evidence has grown in the last couple of decades when developing new models, methods, techniques and tools in research. Furthermore, industrial decision-making ought to become more evidence-based. The objective here is to develop and present an evidence-based profile, which could be used to divide pieces of evidence into dif- ferent types and hence creating an overall picture of evidence in a specific case. The evidence profile is developed in such a way that it allows evidence to be judged in context. The evidence profile consists of five types of evidence, and the profile is illustrated for perspective-based reading. It is shown how pieces of evi- dence can be classified into the different types. It is concluded that this type of ap- proach may be useful to capture the evidence with respect to a specific topic and in a specific context. The further work includes applying the evidence profile for evidence collected from different type of studies and contexts. Introduction},
