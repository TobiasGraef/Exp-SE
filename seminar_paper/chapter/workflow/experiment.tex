\subsection{Designing, Conducting And Interpreting Experiments}
\label{subsec:designing conducting and interpreting experiment}
To generate evidence, experiments are conducted. To keep the complexity of the study manageable and to prevent side effects, it is recommended to answer only one question per experiment. If the question is too extensive for a single experiment, split up the question in sub-questions and recursively start this process for each sub-question.\\
Guidance and documentation through the experiment is provided by \briefingform introduced in section \ref{sec:briefing form}. Since experimenting is a very complex topic and can not be fully covered in this paper, see \cite{Wohlin2012,Tullis2013} for further reading.
