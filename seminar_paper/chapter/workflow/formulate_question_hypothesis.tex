\subsection{Formulating Research Question and Hypothesis}
\label{subsec:formulating research question and hypothesis}

To produce relevant results and fully understand their research domain, developing a good research question is integral for researchers. A good research question is supported by a hypothesis and sometimes objectives \cite{Farrugia2009}. These components should be carefully designed \emph{before} conducting the study that tries to answer the question. Otherwise it is more likely to produce questions that are already answered, or \q{could potentially lead to spuriously positive findings of association through chance alone} \cite[p. 280]{Farrugia2009}. This seems to be especially true for students \cite{Rainer2006}. Therefore, this section addresses issue \ref{itm:issue1} from table \ref{table:issuesEBSE}.
