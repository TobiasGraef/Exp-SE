\subsection{Formulating Research Question and Hypothesis}
\label{subsec:formulating research question and hypothesis}

For researchers to produce relevant results and understand their research domain fully, the step of developing a good research question, with a supporting hypothesis and sometimes objectives is integral \cite{Farrugia2009}. These components should be carefully designed \emph{before} conducting the study that tries to answer the question. Otherwise it is more likely to produce questions that are already answered, or \q{could potentially lead to spuriously positive findings of association through chance alone} \cite[p. 280]{Farrugia2009}. This seems to be especially true for students \cite{Rainer2006}. Therefore, we will address issue \ref{itm:issue1} from table \ref{table:issuesEBSE} with this section. \todosoft{is this too blunt?}
