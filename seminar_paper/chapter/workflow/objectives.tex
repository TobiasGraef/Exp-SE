\subsubsection{Objectives}

 Sometimes researchers define objectives to their hypotheses. They are active statements that \obsrvQuote{define specific aims of the study and should be clearly stated} \cite[p. 280]{Farrugia2009} at the beginning of research. Objectives help to define the study (e.g. helping to calculate sample size). \cite{Farrugia2009,Vickers} Although we do not include objectives in our \briefingform we would like to mention them for reasons of completeness.
