\subsubsection{Objectives}

Sometimes researchers add objectives to their hypotheses. They are active statements that \q{define specific aims of the study and should be clearly stated} \cite[p. 280]{Farrugia2009} at the beginning of research. Objectives help to outline the study (e.g. helping to calculate sample size) \cite{Farrugia2009,Vickers}. Objectives are not included in \briefingform but are mentioned here for completeness.
