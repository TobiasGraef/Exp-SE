\todosoft{Text}
In this step the whole study should be discussed, with respect to limitations and scope of generalization. The study should be put in larger context to the concerning field of research. Additionally future approaches and increments can be discussed here. For guidance in analyzing the own study it is recommended to use a checklist as proposed by Dyb{\aa} \etal (see fig. \ref{fig:critical appraisal}).

Make sure, to only discuss the content of the study. For reflection on the process, see section \ref{subsec:evaluate process}.
