\todo{text}\\
- Evidence Substantial? For Evidence classification maybe quote:\\
\cite{Wohlin2013EvidenceProfile} or \\
\url{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305632179_Evidence-based_software_engineering} (\q{Strength of Evidence}) \textit{(mendeley import adds wrong meta-data, therefor just an url and not an actual reference yet)}\\
- maybe reference to different types of bias\\
- make sure evidence fits to the question\\
- accept or reject hypothesis\\
- answer research question accordingly\\
