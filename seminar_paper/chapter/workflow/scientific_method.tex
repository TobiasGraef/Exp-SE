\subsection {Scientific Method}
\label{subsec:scientific method}

The scientific method is a model which describes the working process of scientific working in general. In figure \ref{fig:SCIENTIFIC_METHOD}, the \checklist process is mapped on the scientific method. The colors indicate which steps of \checklist correspond to which steps of the scientific process. \\
A large part of the scientific method is focused on finding research topics (white) and formulating research questions (yellow). In contrast \checklist focuses on answering the research question. This is represented by multiple colors being mapped onto only two steps and two transitions in figure  \ref{fig:SCIENTIFIC_METHOD}. The steps marked white are not contained in \checklist.
The different focuses are caused by advisors usually assigning students a narrow research topic or a specific research question.
