For researchers to produce relevant results and understand their research domain fully, the step of developing a good research question, with a supporting hypothesis and sometimes objectives is integral \cite{Farrugia2009}. These components should be carefully designed \emph{before} conducting the study that tries to answer the question. Otherwise it is more likely to produce questions that are already answered, or \obsrvQuote{could potentially lead to spuriously positive findings of association through chance alone.} \cite[p. 280]{Farrugia2009}
