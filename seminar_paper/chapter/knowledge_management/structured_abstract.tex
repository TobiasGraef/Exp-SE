\subsection{Structured Abstract}

\todo{importance of abstracts}: Abstracts, together with the title, are used to identify relevant research, not only in SLRs. Often the abstract is the only part of the paper that can be accessed for free. Therefore abstract and title should contain all necessary information to decide whether a paper (in case of SLR: primary study) is relevant in this context. (source: \q{Lessons from applying the systematic literature review process within the software engineering domain})
	$\rightarrow$ quality of abstract crucial for research, how to support researcher in writing useful abstracts? Structured Abstracts provide guidance for writer and reader. \red{end TODO}
\newline

In their guidelines for reporting experiments in software engineering Jedlitschka et al. \cite{Jedlitschka2008} propose the use of \emph{structured abstracts}. They adopted the idea from medicine and psychology, where structured abstracts were introduced to increase the quality of abstracts. Although a variety of different elements is used (see for example \q{Adoption of structured abstracts by general medical journals and format for a structured abstract
}), the most common elements of structured abstracts are \emph{Background} (\emph{or Context}), \emph{Objective} (or \emph{Aim}), \emph{Methods}, \emph{Results} and \emph{Conclusion} (or \emph{Discussion}). Jedlitschka et al. \cite{Jedlitschka2008} suggest the use of a 6th (\todo{or sixth?} heading called \emph{limitations}. This additional information is necessary to decide whether a result can be transfered to another context. Others \todo{often? mostly?} (e.g. Kitchenham et al. \cite{KBO2008}) include this information in the \emph{conclusion} section.

The list and description of elements below closely follows the suggestion of Jedlitschka et al.\cite{Jedlitschka2008}.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Background} or \textbf{Context}: Explain briefly what the motivation for conducting the study was and refers to previous research.
	\item \textbf{Objective} or \textbf{Aim}: Describes the purpose of the study, including the object that is studied as well as focus and perspective. \todo{research question/hypothese?}
	\item \textbf{Methods}: Sums up which research methods were used, for example experimental design, setting, participants and selection criteria, intervention and measurement and analyzing technique.
	\item \textbf{Results}: The key findings are described here (Do not include interpretations here!).
	\item \textbf{Limitations}: Describes the scope  of the study to point out the limits of generalization (This element might be incorporated in the \emph{conclusion}-element).
	\item \textbf{Conclusion}:  Contains the interpretation of results and puts them into context.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item About completeness and clarity of structured abstracts:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Structured abstracts include more relevant information and are easier to read than conventional abstracts. \cite{Budgen2008} \cite{Budgen2007}
	\item Inexperienced authors are likely to produce clearer and more complete abstracts when using a structured form.\cite{Budgen2011} 
	\item On average structured abstracts are longer (limitations in conclusion is a good idea to prevent lengthy abstracts) and have better readability than unstructured abstracts. \cite{KBO2008}
	\item these findings are in accordance with the ones in other disciplines (\red{source: \q{Current findings from research on structured abstracts[: an update]}})

\item use standard terminology (commonly used industry terms) \cite{Jedlitschka2008}, no abbreviations \cite{KBO2008}
\item structured abstracts are longer and often size is limited (journals): prioritize traditional elements, still structured: background (one sentence), objective, method, results, and conclusion \cite{Jedlitschka2008}
\newline
unstructured abstracts should still contain the elements
