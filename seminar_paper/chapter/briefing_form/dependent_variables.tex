\paragraph{Dependent Variables}

An experiment focuses on the effect of independent variables on dependent variables. Therefore dependent variables are the variables that are measured. For example the code quality of a software project is the dependent variable used in the pair programming example from \ref{subsec:formulating research question and hypothesis}, under Hypothesis.
