\subsection{Conclusion}
\label{subsec:conclusion}

This part contains the findings and conclusion of the study. The conclusion indicates whether the question is answered or if more research has to be done on this issue. This includes an interpretation of the experiment results, and the verification of $H_0$ which is either accepting or rejecting $H_0$. Accepting $H_0$ leads to rejection of $H_1$ and vice versa. Also a short statement on the scope of generalization should be given.
