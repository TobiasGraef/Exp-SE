\subsection{Conclusion}
\label{subsec:conclusion}

This is the interesting part for searching researchers: What was found during the study? When searching for evidence researchers often like to see what question the study is about and what it finds. The conclusion indicates whether the question is answered or if more research has to be done on this issue. This includes an interpretation of the experiment results, and the verification or rejection of $H_0$ (and acceptance of $H_1$). Also a short statement on the scope of generalization should be given. In the end it must be clear if the given research question is answered and in what direction. \todosoft{last sentence is not so nice.}
