\paragraph{Controlled Variables}

The last role a variable can play during an experiment is the role of a controlled variable. These are variable which have or may have an effect on the dependent variables, but are not focus of the study. Therefore they are controlled by the researcher and kept constant throughout the experiment \cite{BuddiesVariables}. The test environment of a software, the gender of participants, or the number of trials per group are good examples for controlled variables in software engineering research.
