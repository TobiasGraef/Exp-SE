\paragraph{Controlled Variables}

The third variable category are controlled variables. They have or may have an effect on the dependent variables, but are not focus of the study. Therefore they are controlled by the researcher and kept constant throughout the experiment \cite{BuddiesVariables}. Examples for controlled variables in software engineering research are: the test environment of a software, the gender of participants, or the number of trials per group.
