\subsubsection{Research Techniques}

For researchers that sift existing evidence it is sometimes important to know how or by what means a hypothesis was tested. Therefore we included a section for research techniques in the briefing form. The conducting researcher gives here a briefing about which techniques she uses. For example that the experiment is conducted as double blind experiment, using A/B Testing, with a Think aloud session and data is also measured via EEG (Electroencephalography). We use the term techniques here for everything ranging from methods that tell how an experiment is conducted, over measurement techniques, through to the hardware that is used.
