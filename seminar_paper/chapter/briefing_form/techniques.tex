\subsubsection{Research Techniques}

For researchers that sift through existing evidence it is important to know by which means a hypothesis was tested. Therefore a section for research techniques is included in \briefingform. Here the conducting researcher gives a brief resume about which techniques are used. For example: the experiment is conducted as double blind experiment, using A/B testing, with a think aloud session and data is also measured via EEG (Electroencephalography). The term techniques is used for everything ranging from methods that tell how an experiment is conducted, over measurement techniques, through to the hardware that is used. For further reading and more details on research techniques, measurement methods and study design see \cite{Albert2008,Wohlin2012}.
