\subsubsection{Research Techniques}

For researchers that sift existing evidence it is sometimes important to know how or by what means a hypothesis was tested. Therefore asection for research techniques was included in \briefingform. Here the conducting researcher gives here a brief resume about which techniques she uses. For example that the experiment is conducted as double blind experiment, using A/B Testing, with a Think aloud session and data is also measured via EEG (Electroencephalography). We use the term techniques here for everything ranging from methods that tell how an experiment is conducted, over measurement techniques, through to the hardware that is used. For further reading and more details on research techniques, measurement methods and study design see \cite{Albert2008,Wohlin2012}.
