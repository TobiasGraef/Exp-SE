\subsubsection{Variables}

Variables are operationalizations of concepts. They are split in three types: Dependent, independent and controlled variables \cite{BuddiesVariables,Seltman2015}. A good variable must be measurable by any means \cite{BuddiesVariables}. Seltman additionally defines several qualities of good variables: \q{high reliability, absence of bias, low cost, practicability, objectivity, high acceptance, and high concept validity} \cite[p. 10]{Seltman2015}. The variables can also be classified by their statistical type. Which influences the statistical methods used to evaluate the experiment outcome \cite[p. 12-16]{Seltman2015}.\\
The variables are contained in \briefingform{} to decompose an experiment for quicker overview while searching. Additionally the variables make it easier to evaluate the validity of the evidence.
