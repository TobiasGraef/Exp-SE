\paragraph{Independent Variables}

The variables that are changed by the researcher during the experiment are called independent variables. In the pair programming example in section \ref{subsec:formulating research question and hypothesis}, the independent variable is the technique utilized by the software developers (e.g., pair programming and conventional techniques). It is advisable to only measure one independent variable during one experiment. Unless there is justifiable evidence that two or more independent variables are not effecting the same dependent variable \cite{BuddiesVariables}. Otherwise it is not clear which of the independent variables caused the observed behavior of the measured dependent variable.
