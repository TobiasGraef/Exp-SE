\begin{itemize}
	\item in this paper we propose a one page briefing of research study
	\item supports EBSE and searchability of study
	\item similar to SEED but more detailed structure to support searchability even more.
	\item supports researcher in understanding the field of research
	\item supports researcher in understanding the study itself
	\item guides researcher through study design and result documentation process
	\item contains of: research question, hypothesis, experiment/context or deduction, conclusion
	\item experiment contains: independent and dependent variables (control variables), method, results  
\end{itemize}
