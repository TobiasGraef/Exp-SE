\begin{itemize}
	\item in this paper we propose a one page briefing of research study
	\item supports EBSE and searchability of study
	\item similar to SEED but more detailed structure to support searchability even more.
	\item supports researcher in understanding the field of research
	\item supports researcher in understanding the study itself
	\item guides researcher through study design and result documentation process
	\item contains of: research question, hypothesis, experiment/context or deduction, conclusion
	\item experiment contains: independent and dependent variables (control variables), method, results  
\end{itemize}


\fbox{\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
		{\large\textbf{Question}}\\
		Contains \textbf{\textit{technology}} in a \textbf{\textit{context}} showing an \textbf{\textit{effect}}. TODO Kitchenham Quote (practitioners)?\\
		\exampleQuote{Does pair programming in professional software development teams increases code quality?}
		\\
		\\
		\\
		{\large\textbf{Hypothesis}}\\
		Needs to contain a \textbf{\textit{prediction}} and needs to be \textbf{\textit{testable}}.\\
		\exampleQuote{If you do x, then y will happen}
		\\
		\\
		\\
		{\large\textbf{Experiment}}\\
		\textbf{Context}\\
		\\
		\textbf{Dependent Variables}\\
		Variables that are  \textbf{\textit{measured}} during the study.\\
		\\
		\textbf{Independent Variables}\\
		Variables that are  \textbf{\textit{changed}} during the study.\\
		\\
		\textbf{Control Variables}\\
		Controlled to be as constant as possible.\\
		\\
		\textbf{Technique}\\
		Lab-/Field study, (Double-)Blind, Technique of transcription/logging, ...\\
		\\
		\textbf{TODO Sort}\\
		metric (raw sample vs calculated metric e.g. accuracy) , number of participants (method or controlled?), ...\\
		\\
		\textbf{Statistical Results}\\
		Experiment's outcome. Statistical summary (confidence, variance, etc.)\\
		\textbf{No} interpretation or conclusion!\\
		\\
		\\
		\\
		{\large\textbf{Conclusion}}\\
		Interpretation of experiment's results.\\
		Verifying or Falsifying Hypothesis.\\
		Scope of generalization.

TODO output move conclusion to hypothesis for quicker overview?
