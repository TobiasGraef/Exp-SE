\subsubsection{Statistical Results}
\label{statisticalresults}

The statistical results help validating the solidity of evidence found. They should never contain any interpretation. Interpretations should be given in a conclusion or discussion section separately from the found data.

This field should at least contain the used statistic measurement, method, or model and their resulting parameters (e.g. Analysis of Variance: $F(2.57)=211.496, p<.001)$. It is advisable to use established methods to ensure comparability and reproducibility. More on statistical analysis can be found in books like \cite{Wohlin2012}, or \cite{Albert2008} as already mentioned in section \ref{subsec:designing conducting and interpreting experiment}.
