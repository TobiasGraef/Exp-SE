\subsection{Experiment}

To find cause and effect relationships between variables experiments are conducted \cite{BuddiesVariables}. A more detailed view on experiments in our EBSE workflow \todo{(how do we call this?)} is given in \todo{(link to experiment chapter in workflow)}. An experiment consists of: Variables, techniques, and statistical results. These are integral components to describe a study in brief, and enhance the ability to search for, and evaluate the relevance and validity of a given study.
