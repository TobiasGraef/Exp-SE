\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related work}
Rainer \etal \cite{Rainer2006} released a paper about the use of EBSE by 15 under-graduate students. 
We have used observations listed in the paper to create design guidelines for the documents introduced in section \ref{sec:research process} and \ref{sec:briefing form} . There are seven main issues we tried to address:

There are already databases that are meant to ease the access to studies: SEED \cite{Janzen2008} and the \emph{Evidence Map} \cite{EBSEWeb}.\\
SEED is a community-driven online database that has been created during graduate courses. It lists summaries of studies in a common format and grouped by topics. The studies are added by researchers, whereas users create unstructured summaries, ratings and comparison grids. There only exists a prototype \cite{SEED} that has not been updated since 2009.\\
The Evidence Map is primarily concerned with  classifying systematic literature reviews (secondary studies, see sections \ref{subsec:EBSE} and \ref{subsec:search for existing evidence}), but also provides lists of primary and tertiary studies as well as information and guidelines about EBSE. A major disadvantage is the lack of study summaries. It has not been updated since 2012.

Rainer \etal \cite[p. 7]{Rainer2008} introduced a flowchart to support the use of EBSE. The chart is rather fine grained and therefore might be unsuited for students novice in EBSE and scientific working in general.
