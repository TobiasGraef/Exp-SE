\section {Fundamental Principles}
\label{sec:fundamental principles}
\todo{read through glue text and improve it}\\
This chapter provides the basis for the rest of the paper. It introduces \emph{evidence based software engineering} (EBSE) as well as \emph{structured abstracts} \\
EBSE was introduced in 2004 as an adoption of the evidence based approach in medicine. Kitchenham \etal thought that software engineering could profit from it in a similar manner as medicine did \cite{EBSE}.\\
Finding evidence involves browsing through a lot of publications.  Brereton \etal found that the quality of abstracts is often not sufficient to decide whether a paper (in case of SLR: \todosoft{first occurence of SLR} primary study) is relevant in a specific context. Reading the conclusion solves this issue but increases the time needed to identify relevant studies. Therefore improving the quality of abstracts is  particularly important in the context of EBSE. Structured abstracts are tool to achieve this.
