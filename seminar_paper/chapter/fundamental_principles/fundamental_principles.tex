\section {Fundamental Principles}
\label{sec:fundamental principles}
\todo{glue text}\\
Often the abstract is the only part of the paper that can be accessed for free. Therefore abstract and title should contain all necessary information to decide whether a paper (in case of SLR: primary study) is relevant in a specific context. When searching literature, for example during an SLR, bad quality abstracts increase the time needed. But the quality of abstracts is not always sufficient. Therefore it can be necessary to read the conclusion of a paper to decide its relevance. \cite{Brereton2007}\\
