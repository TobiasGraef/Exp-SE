\section {Fundamental Principles}
\label{sec:fundamental principles}
In this section, \emph{evidence-based software engineering} (EBSE) and structured abstracts are introduced. EBSE is the foundation of the process introduced later in section \ref{sec:research process}. Therefore, the idea behind EBSE is very fundamental  for this paper.\\
Structured abstracts are used as a base for the form introduced in section \ref{sec:briefing form}.\\
