\section {Fundamental Principles}
\label{sec:fundamental principles}
This chapter introduces \emph{evidence-based software engineering} (EBSE) as well as \emph{structured abstracts}.

EBSE introduced in 2004 as an adoption of the evidence-based approach in medicine. Kitchenham \etal thought that software engineering could profit from it in a similar manner as medicine did \cite{EBSE}.
Finding evidence involves browsing through a lot of publications.  Brereton \etal \todo{ref} found that the quality of abstracts is often not sufficient to decide whether a paper  is relevant in a specific context. Reading the conclusion solves this issue but increases the time needed to identify relevant studies. Structured abstracts can be used to improve the quality of abstracts, which is particularly important in the context of EBSE.
