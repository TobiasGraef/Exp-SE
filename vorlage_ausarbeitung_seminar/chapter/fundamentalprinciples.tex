\section{Fundamental Principles}

short introduction to EBSE,..

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Evidence-based approach}: integrate all available research (evidence) in decision making process
	\item \textbf{Aim}: \q{EBSE aims to improve decision making related to software development and maintenance by integrating current best evidence from research with practical experience and human values.} \cite{EBSEpract}
	\item \textbf{Five steps} of practising EBSE \cite{EBSE}:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Ask an answerable question.
			\item Find the best evidence that answers that question.
			\item Critically appraise this evidence.
			\item Apply the evidence (and critical appraisal).
			\item Evaluate the performance in previous steps.
		\end{enumerate}
		$\rightarrow$ important tool: Systematic Literature Review (SLR)
	\item \textbf{SLR} \cite{keele2007}: identify and interpret all available literature regarding a research question
		$\rightarrow$ papers should be written for synthesis (TODO requirements for this, common mistakes/problems?)
\end{itemize}
