\subsubsection{Research Question}

The question the later study is designed to answer is called research question \cite{Vickers}. It should be an answerable question and address a relevant issue in the research area \cite{Dyba2005}. Preceding a research question is the need for a deep understanding of the topics that have already been studied, in order to produce questions which drive knowledge further. The questions that arise during the acquisition of knowledge, and cannot be answered by means of EBSE, are likely appropriate questions for further research \cite{Farrugia2009}. \newline
There are two general classes of research questions: qualitative and quantitative questions. Qualitative research states questions which report, describe, or explore a subject \cite[p. 139-141]{Creswell2014}. In computer science as the research field matures these questions become more and more rare {\color{red} (find source)}. Therefore focus is on quantitative research questions in this paper. \newline
To understand the structure of research questions Shaw provides a model where she categorizes research questions from software engineering papers in five types \cite{Shaw2002} {\color{red} (maybe cut out)}. \newline
